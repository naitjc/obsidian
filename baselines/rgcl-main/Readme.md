# RGCL

RGCL (Retrieval-Guided Contrastive Learning) is a method for improving hateful meme detection through dynamic retrieval and contrastive learning.

## Quick Start

1. Set up the environment following the [Environment Setup](#environment-setup) section
2. Prepare your datasets as described in [Dataset Preparation](#dataset-preparation)
3. Run `bash scripts/experiments.sh` to start training

## Environment Setup

Create and activate a new conda environment:
```shell
conda create -n RGCL python=3.10 -y
conda activate RGCL
```

Install PyTorch:
```shell
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y
```

Install FAISS:
```shell
conda install -c pytorch -c nvidia faiss-gpu=1.7.4 mkl=2021 blas=1.0=mkl -y
```

Install additional requirements:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Dataset Preparation

### Image Data
Place all images in the `./data/image/dataset_name/All` directory structure.

**Examples:**
- `./data/image/FB/All/12345.png`
- `./data/image/HarMeme/All/`
- `./data/image/Propaganda/All/`

### Annotation Data
Place JSONL annotation files in the `./data/gt/dataset_name` directory.

### Generate CLIP Embeddings
To optimize training efficiency, CLIP embeddings are pre-generated to avoid redundant computation during training.

```shell
python3 src/utils/generate_CLIP_embedding_HF.py --dataset "FB"
python3 src/utils/generate_CLIP_embedding_HF.py --dataset "HarMeme"
```

### Generate ALIGN Embeddings
```shell
python3 src/utils/generate_ALIGN_embedding_HF.py --dataset "FB"
python3 src/utils/generate_ALIGN_embedding_HF.py --dataset "HarMeme"
```

### Generate Sparse Retrieval Index (Optional)
We provide Sparse Retrieval as a comparison to the proposed dynamic retrieval method in RGCL.
#### VinVL Bounding Box Prediction 
Object detection bounding boxes were generated using VinVL. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide pre-extracted bounding box predictions for the HatefulMemes dataset:

**Download:** [HuggingFace Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jingbiao/rgcl-sparse-retrieval/tree/main)  


## Training and Evaluation

Run the following command to start training and evaluation:
```shell
bash scripts/experiments.sh
```

### Common Issues

**Training Hangs or Freezes:**  
If training appears to be stuck, this is often related to the FAISS installation. Ensure FAISS-GPU is properly installed following the environment setup instructions above.

# RA-HMD


## RA-HMD Stage 1 Code

The Stage 1 training code is based on an updated version of [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory). We provide **two versions** as separate submodules:

- **`RA-HMD/LLAMA-FACTORY`**: Default version with Qwen2.5-VL support (recommended for reproduction)
- **`RA-HMD/LLAMA-FACTORY-Ver202512`**: Latest December 2025 version with InternVL-3, Qwen3-VL support

**Note:** Both versions are newer than the original paper implementation. Minor variations in results may occur due to version differences. Choose based on your target model.

### Environment Setup (Default Version)

Clone the repository and set up the environment:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/JingbiaoMei/RGCL.git
cd RGCL

# Initialize and update submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Navigate to the LLaMA-Factory submodule
cd RA-HMD/LLAMA-FACTORY
conda create -n llamafact python=3.10 -y
conda activate llamafact
pip install -e ".[torch,metrics,deepspeed,liger-kernel,bitsandbytes,qwen]"
pip install torchmetrics wandb easydict
pip install qwen_vl_utils torchvision
# Install FAISS
conda install -c pytorch -c nvidia faiss-gpu=1.7.4 mkl=2021 blas=1.0=mkl -y
```


### Dataset Preparation

**Download:**  
Original datasets and LLaMA-Factory-compatible formats are available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jingbiao/RA-HMD).

**Format:**  
The dataset follows the ShareGPT-style conversational format required by LLaMA-Factory. Below is an example entry from `data/dataset_info.json`.

**Important:** Place the actual JSON file (e.g., `sharegpt_FB_train_instructblip.json`) into the path specified under `file_name`:
```json
  "hatefulmemes": {
    "file_name": "gt/FB/sharegpt_FB_train_instructblip.json",
    "formatting": "sharegpt",
    "columns": {
      "messages": "messages",
      "images": "images"
    },
    "tags": {
      "role_tag": "role",
      "content_tag": "content",
      "user_tag": "user",
      "assistant_tag": "assistant"
    }
```

### Reproduced Qwen2.5-VL Results

In addition to the Qwen2-VL results reported in the paper, we provide evaluation results using **Qwen2.5-VL-7B** on the same benchmarks.

| Model             | HatefulMemes (Acc) | HatefulMemes (F1) | MAMI (Acc) | MAMI (F1) | PrideMM (Acc) | PrideMM (F1) |
|-------------------|-------------------:|------------------:|------------:|-----------:|---------------:|--------------:|
| **RA-HMD (Qwen2.5-VL-7B)** | 80.8 | 80.1 | 81.0 | 81.0 | 78.0 | 77.8 |
| **RA-HMD (Qwen2-VL-7B)** | 82.1 | 79.7 | 79.9 | 81.2 | 78.1 | 78.4 |
| **RA-HMD (Qwen2.5-VL-3B)** | 79.5 | 76.2 | 80.7 | 80.1 | 77.1 | 77.6 |
| **RA-HMD (Qwen2-VL-2B)** | 79.1 | 77.7 | 79.4 | 79.1 | 76.0 | 76.7 |

The rubric-based LLM-as-Judge evaluation on HatefulMemes yields a score of **5.4** for RA-HMD (Qwen2.5-VL-7B) explanations.

**Summary:** RA-HMD (Qwen2.5-VL-7B) achieves comparable performance to RA-HMD (Qwen2-VL-7B), with minor variations across different metrics.


### December 2025 Update - Support for Latest Models

**LLaMA-Factory Ver2025.12** is now available with support for the latest models including InternVL-3, Qwen3-VL, and more. We provide a ported version of RA-HMD Stage 1 training code compatible with this release as a separate submodule.

#### Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/JingbiaoMei/RGCL.git
cd RGCL

# Initialize and update submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Navigate to the Ver202512 LLaMA-Factory submodule
cd RA-HMD/LLAMA-FACTORY-Ver202512
conda create -n llamafact202512 python=3.10 -y
conda activate llamafact202512
pip install -e ".[torch,metrics,deepspeed,liger-kernel,bitsandbytes,qwen]"
pip install torchmetrics wandb easydict qwen_vl_utils torchvision
# Install FAISS
conda install -c pytorch -c nvidia faiss-gpu=1.7.4 mkl=2021 blas=1.0=mkl -y
```

#### Troubleshooting

**Slow Tokenization:**  
If you experience extremely slow tokenization, set `use_fast_tokenizer: false` in the LLaMA-Factory config files. See [issue #8600](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory/issues/8600) for details.

**Slow Training with PyTorch 2.9:**  
Training may become extremely slow when using PyTorch 2.9 with Qwen3-VL. Consider downgrading to an earlier PyTorch version. See [Qwen3-VL issue #1701](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-VL/issues/1701) for more information.


## RA-HMD Stage 2 Code

Stage 1 fine-tuning delivers strong in-domain supervised performance. As shown in our ablation studies, Stage 2 does not significantly improve in-domain metrics. However, Stage 2 introduces a contrastive learning objective that enhances retrieval quality, leading to better generalization in cross-dataset, out-of-domain, and adversarial scenarios. Thus, if your focus is only on in-domain performance, Stage 1 suffices. The stage 2's complexity is not justified for marginal in-domain gains.

Stage 2 requires an additional preprocessing step:
- First, generate LMM embeddings using `RA-HMD/LLAMA-FACTORY/src/llamafactory/custom/extract_features.py`.
- Then, use the generated embeddings to refine the MLP layers via Stage 2 fine-tuning. The training scripts for Stage 2 are located in `RA-HMD/Stage2`.
